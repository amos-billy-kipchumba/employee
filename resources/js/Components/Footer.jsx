                  LinkPath Services has shown remarkable progress, as
                  evidenced by its short but impressive history, and has proven itself
                  a worthy competitor to even the long-standing giants of the
                  business. The agency’s staggering growth is largely attributable to
                  the thorough, painstaking effort of its consultants to familiarize
                  themselves with the nature and scope of their clients’ jobs, which
                  thus enables them to sift out and tailor the multitude of talented
                  jobseekers according to the preferences and requirements as
                  specified by their clients.

                <p>
                  Since our inception in 2010, we have aspired towards providing
                  excellent service with consistency and unfaltering dedication,
                  conscientiously sieving out from our database of talent the best
                  candidates for the job. Those who possess the qualities and criteria
                  as desired and specified by the agency’s clients are put through a
                  series of tests and interviews that ultimately determine the depth
                  and relevance of their expertise. By this rigorous method of
                  screening, LinkPath Services is thus able to ensure
                  that it brings about an ideal, effective, and mutually beneficial
                  partnership, a lucrative alliance that satisfies both employer and
                  employee. <br />
                  As the very bridge that brings together both parties, LinkPath
                  International Services not only contributes to alleviating the
                  stress of manpower scarcity facing a great number of recruitment
                  companies today but, at the same time, it provides the jobless
                  talents of society with the opportunity to secure for themselves a
                  stable, lifelong career. The firm possesses a committed, reliable
                  staff of knowledgeable advisors who are ever prepared to render
                  their services with a swiftness and efficacy that not many can
                  match.
